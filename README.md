# Project Description

Our project addresses various challenges in creating a user-friendly and efficient product suggestion system. Below are some of the key challenges we have tackled:

1. **Displaying Icons for Categorical Variables:** We have successfully displayed icons for categorical variables in our user interface. For instance, each product suggestion is accompanied by a review section depicted using a 5-star rating scale. The JSON response provides float values for ratings, and we have integrated these seamlessly.

2. **Variable Length Lists with RecyclerView:** Our response is a variable-length list of product suggestions that dynamically adjusts based on search queries. These product suggestions are displayed as cards in a RecyclerView, ensuring a responsive and adaptable user interface.

3. **Handling Variable Length Strings:** Product names and brands can vary in length for each product. To address this, we have implemented a constraint layout inside each card. When collapsed, only two lines of the product name are displayed, and the full name is revealed when the card is expanded.

4. **Inputting Variable Numbers of Values:** We have provided a user-friendly interface with a variety of input controls, including radio buttons, dropdowns, toggle switches, and text fields. This allows users to input search queries with different requirements and preferences.

In addition to these challenges, we have met several other constraints:

- **Equal Team Contributions:** Each team member has contributed equally to the project's success.
- **Spinner Wheel for Loading Progress:** We have incorporated a spinner wheel to visually indicate loading progress, enhancing the user experience.
- **Non-blocking Main Thread:** Our application ensures that the main thread is not blocked, guaranteeing smooth and responsive interactions.
- **Error Handling:** We have implemented robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
- **InstanceState Management:** To maintain a seamless user experience, we have properly saved and handled instance state.
